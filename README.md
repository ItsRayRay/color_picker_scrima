# color_picker_scrima

This is my fourth project, created while following the Scrimba learning path. The project is a color picker web application that allows users to select colors from a range of different palettes.

One of the key learning points of this project was working with an API for the first time. I learned how to make an API call to retrieve data, and how to use that data to populate the color palettes in the application. This was an exciting opportunity to learn a new skill and further develop my understanding of web development.
or palette.

Overall, this project was a great way to learn more about API calls and how to use them in a web application. Feel free to check out the color picker and give it a try!
