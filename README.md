# color_picker_scrima

This is my fourth project, created while following the Scrimba learning path. The project is a color picker web application that allows users to select colors from a range of different palettes.

One of the key learning points of this project was working with an API for the first time. I learned how to make an API call to retrieve data, and how to use that data to populate the color palettes in the application.
